# Exam Record 0.2.0 fixtures

- [`schema.json`](schema.json) is a version-pinned copy of the public schema whose
  stable identifier is `https://testparrot.com/formats/exam/0.2.0/schema.json`.
- [`examples/`](examples/) contains conforming Exam Records. An Exam Record is
  importable only inside a Test Parrot Package. `section-headings.json` rewords
  two sections and prints every heading large; `header.json` gives the Exam its own
  header, different on its first page.
- Invalid counterexamples are with the package, in
  [`../../package/0.1.0/invalid/`](../../package/0.1.0/invalid/).

The prose contract is in
[`docs/exam-record-0.2.0.md`](../../../../docs/exam-record-0.2.0.md).
