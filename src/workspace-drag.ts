// What a drag gesture across the authoring workspace means.
//
// One gesture spans two panes. A Question Bank question is *composed* onto the
// Working Copy; a Working Copy question is *moved* within it. Either way a drop
// only ever Inserts: before or after a rendered question, at the end of an
// empty Question Section, or into a new Section of its own.
//
// A Question Section holds Questions of any type, so every line between two
// questions, in any Section, is somewhere a question can go.
//
// And a drop is never aimed. Released anywhere over the Working Copy, a gesture
// lands at the legal insertion line nearest the pointer. The one exception is
// a new Section, which is only ever made on purpose: when the nearest line is
// the foot of a Section — below its last question — a "new Section" target
// opens beneath it, and only a release over that open target
// makes one. The target opens rather than appearing at once, so the sheet does
// not jump under the pointer, and it says what it will do before it does it.
// The only release that changes nothing is one outside the Working Copy,
// which is how a gesture is abandoned.
//
// This is the whole of the geometry, kept pure and away from the DOM so the
// rule can be read and tested on its own. `use-workspace-drag.ts` is what
// reads the rendered questions out of the real page and turns an intent into
// exactly one call to the store.
