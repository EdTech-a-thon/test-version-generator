// Hidden Answers: the incorrect answers an Exam leaves off a Multiple Choice
// question (ADR-0038).
//
// A Question in its bank keeps every answer it was written with; a position on
// an Exam may show fewer of its incorrect ones. Which ones is Exam
// presentation, like answer order, so it lives in an arrangement beside
// `choiceOrder` and never touches Question Content. Like an order, it is
// tolerated rather than validated: an id that is no longer an incorrect,
// unlocked answer of the question is ignored, and so the rules below are
// applied every time it is read, not only when it is written —
//
// - the correct answer and every Locked Answer always show;
// - at least one incorrect answer always shows;
// - nothing hides while no answer is marked correct, since there would be no
//   telling a distractor from the answer, nor beside an answer that names
//   others by letter, as “Both A and B”, whose letters hiding would change.
//
// The answers shown keep the arrangement's order and close up: a Locked
// Answer last stays last, as “All of the above” must.
