 *   photo — starts a new import, which waits for the file its AI makes;
 * - the file an AI made (JSON) is the answer to the import in progress it
 *   matches, and continues that import;
 * - a Test Parrot file is imported as it is.
 *
 * AI-made JSON that matches no import in progress, and names pictures only a
 * test could supply, has nowhere to go: that is an error, with what to do.
 * One that names no pictures — made from a test given to the AI as text —
 * needs no test, and is imported as it is.
